## Project Description

This project demonstrates the application of the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework to analyze and predict Airbnb rental prices in Boston. Using data from the [Boston Airbnb dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston/data), the aim is to systematically approach a data mining project, from understanding the business problem to deploying a model. By understanding the factors that influence Airbnb rental prices, hosts can optimize their listings and maximize revenue.

### Significance

As a former consultant and current data scientist, this project serves as an educational resource, illustrating that by clearly identifying and articulating the problem, we ensure that the project's goals align with the client's objectives, address the right scope, and focus on specific challenges. This structured approach not only enhances the clarity and effectiveness of the analysis but also provides a replicable methodology for future data mining projects.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
- **Identify and Articulate the Business Problem**: Understand the client's objectives, the scope of the issue, and the specific challenges related to Airbnb rental pricing in Boston.
- **Data Exploration and Understanding**: Gain insights from the dataset to identify key factors influencing rental prices.
- **Data Preparation and Cleaning**: Process the dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis and modeling.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**: Develop models to estimate rental prices and evaluate their performance.
